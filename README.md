## Credits
Queenmaker was made using the Godot engine version 4.0

The page flipping sound effect in the game's intro was generously provided by [soundjay.com](https://www.soundjay.com/page-flip-sounds-1.html#google_vignette). The same is true for the bell sound effect on the death screen.

The beehive sounds on the title screen, *Beehive at night*, are by Islabonita on [pixbay.com](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/beehive-at-night-61816/)

The jump sound effect, *Wings of insects*, is by Aleks41 also from pixbay. The same is true for JonCon Library's *Bee Buzzing* and dlp coasters' *Aggressive Bees* which were used for the damage and attack sound effects respectively.
