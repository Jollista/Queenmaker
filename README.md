The page flipping sound effect in the game's intro was generously provided by [soundjay.com](https://www.soundjay.com/page-flip-sounds-1.html#google_vignette). The same is true for the bell sound effect on the death screen.

The beehive sounds on the title screen, *Beehive at night*, are by [Islabonita](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/beehive-at-night-61816/) on [pixbay.com](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/bees/)

The jump sound effect, *Wings of insects*, is by [Aleks41]() also from pixbay. The same is true for [JonCon Library](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/bee-buzzing-6254/)'s *Bee Buzzing* and [dlp coasters](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/agressive-bees-45822/)' *Aggressive Bees* which were used for the damage and attack sound effects respectively.

The music, *Bonfire*, was written by Alexander Nakarada. The music played during the boss fight is a 60 second cut of Flight of the Bubble Bee by [Videvo](https://www.videvo.net/royalty-free-music-track/the-flight-of-the-bumble-bee-60s/231158/) and the song of course was originally composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1899.
